# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer: A hash in ruby is a collection of data, which can be a mix between any of the primitive data types like strings, numbers, booleans, ect.. To have a hash you need to have a key:value pairs. Which basically means you need a unique name for the key so you can call upon on it, and a value which can be any primitive data type. Values, unlike keys, don't have to unique to be used.

  Researched answer: A unique key:value pairs. Instead of calling upon an index, you would call upon a the unique key. Now if you attempted to call upon a key that doesn't exist, all you would get in return is 'nil'.



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: A gem is a file library that has preloaded files like rspec. Gem's are usefull when it comes to coding because the developer dosen't have to waste time making possibly hundreds of files of code just to get a project set up. They are a lifesaver as a developer when it comes to meeting deadlines of projects 

  Researched answer: Gem's aare commonly shared and distrubuted among other ruby users to extend the capability of their application, or to use as reusable code inside of their own rails projects.



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on Rails is an open source web development tool that uses the Ruby program to develop applications. It's similar to React.js in the way that the code you write can be updated to the webpage it is assigned to. Both also have a local server function so you can see what you're doing live to the webpage.

  Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is a full stack framework that focus on developer usablility. Ontop of rending a full webpage and the code that runs it, Ruby on Rails also has a basic security functionality built in it.



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: I'm not sure what a relational database is, I'll have to research that question afterwards. I do know that databases in general are there to store large amounts of information. For instance you can make a database that stores all the user information of people who sign up to your website or other user based product.

  Researched answer: "A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data points with defined relationships for easy access. In the relational database model, the data structures -- including data tables, indexes and views -- remain separate from the physical storage structures, enabling database administrators to edit the physical data storage without affecting the logical data structure." There are multiple databases that can be used, but the top three from my research, besides relational databases are hierarchical database systems, network database systems, and object-oriented database systems.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys refer to spefic id's inside of a database that can't have the same id number. Starting at 1 and going until no more user are assigned a number, these numbers help when it comes to associating specfic information to a specific id. They're also important because it allows the developer to update specific information based off that one primary key, instead of updating all user information across the board. 

  Researched answer: Primary keys are located inside of a column with the database table. Along with that, the database table can't have columns without a primary key inside of it, nor can a table contain a null value with a primary key.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: RESTful routes provide a path from the HTTP verbs to the controller CRUD action. THis is helpful because it doesn't require a URL to redirect the webpage to the correct site.

2. JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is used for storing and transmitting data between a server and a web page.

3. ERB: Stands for, Embedded Ruby. ERB allows ruby users to generate any kind of text from templates.

4. Params: Params in rails refer to when parameters are being passed to the controller by the 'get' or 'post' request.

5. API: Stands for, Application Program Interface. API's help transfer data from an outside sources through the internet, into the local application
